To the interested reader,
\\

This document is a compilation of lecture notes taken during the Fall 2023 semester for MATH3001: Analysis I at the University of Colorado Boulder. The course used \textit{Analysis With an Introduction to Proof}\footnote{Lay, S. R. (2014). Analysis With an Introduction to Proof (5th ed.). Pearson.} by Steven Lay as its primary text. Supplemental texts included Walter Rudin's \textit{Principles of Mathematical Analysis}\footnote{Rudin, W. (1976). Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill, Inc.} and Stephen Abbott's \textit{Understanding Analysis}\footnote{Abbott, S. (2016). Understanding Analysis (2nd ed.). Springer.}. As such, many theorems, definitions, and content may be quoted or derived from the aforementioned books. This course was taught by Carla Farsi, Ph. D.

In addition to the aforementioned supplemental texts, the author would like to provide the following resources for students currently taking an analysis course:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/}{Casey Rodriguez' MIT OpenCourseWare Real Analysis Course}
    \item Terrence Tao's \textit{Analysis I} and \textit{Analysis II}.
\end{enumerate}
